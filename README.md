## Demo of code generation for CLJ-SYD meetup

This repo shows how to build a plugin for [Hodur](https://github.com/luchiniatwork/hodur-engine)
that generates cljc code that provides a simple ORM layer for a Datascript database.

To drive this, explore the [test namespace](https://github.com/stevebuik/clj-code-gen-hodur/tree/master/test/orm)

The fixtures sample data matches the domain entities used in
[Alain's repo](https://github.com/alain-picard/clj-syd-datascript-and-reagent/blob/datascript-example/src/hello_world/app.cljs)
since this presentation is designed to follow Alains.

There is no slide-deck for this talk but there is another
[markdown document](https://github.com/stevebuik/clj-code-gen-hodur/blob/master/talking-points.md)
with talking points made in the presentation.
